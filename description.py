about = """Welcome to Import and Export Prediction System


This “Import and Export Prediction System” is 
prediction  system,  designed  to  predict  and
forecast the future import and export values of
various  agricultural  products  of Nepal. This 
system  evaluates  the   trend  of  import  and
exports of top listed  agricultural products on
basis  of time  series  since 2009.The data for
predicted  products  are  collected from Export
Import Data  Bank,  Undertaking  of  Trade  and
Export Promotion  Center Nepal. This  System is
simple prototype of time series trend  analysis
and prediction, proposed to visualize the trend
and predict values of agricultural goods coming
in and going out, using  the  concept  of ARIMA
model.   And  finally,   to   per-evaluate  the
increase in trade imbalance of the products.

This  is  proposed  and designed for the partial
fulfillment  of  requirements  for the degree of
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering.
All  the  feedback  and  comments  are  heartily
welcomed. Necessary features will be enhanced in

future.    """

rice = """              ---Import of Rice---              


Nearly 70  percent of Nepal's population depends
directly   on   agirculture,   and   the  sector
contributes more than a  quater of the country's
GDP - with  rice  making  up 21 percent of that.
Till as  late as 1985,  Nepal  used to  be a net
exproter  of  rice,  and  during  the  1960s the
country was  exporting $45 million worth of rice
to India every year. How the tables have turned,
in 2015 Neapl has to import 531,000 tons of rice
worth $210 million form India.

There are many reasons why Nepal’s production of
rice has not kept up with demand. The  foremost,
of course, is that the country’s  population has
doubled  in the  intervening years. Agricultural
land is  shrinking  because of urban sprawl, and
much  of  the  farms  are  fallow    because  of
outmigration.  The educated youth do not want to
live off the land anymore, and look for salaried
jobs in the  cities or abroad."""



potato = """             ---Import of Potato---              


Potato  is considered  as one of the fourth most
important  crops in the  world after wheat, rice
and maize. It is one of the important cash crops
to address  food  insecurity  and reduce poverty
among  smallholder  farmers  in  the  developing
countries like Nepal. Its cultivation is popular
among  farmers  due  to its  wider adaptability,
high  yield  potential  and  high  demand  which
contributes about  6.57 and 2.17 precent in AGDP
and GDP, respectively. Potato is cultivated as a
subsistence crop which is the best potential for
yield increment. 

Potatoes are used as  subsidiary food as part of
vegetables in Terai  region,  whereas  as staple
food in Hill and Mountain regions. The demand of
potato  in the form of  chips, fries  and mashed
potatoes  has widened  its scope  which helps to
uplift  the  economic condition  of  smallholder
farmers. """


apple = """             ---Import of Apple---              


Aside from seeing diverse landscape and abundant
wildlife  and   learning  about   vibrant  local
culture  and traditions, there is another reason
to  head  to  the  far-western Nepali highlands.
That is to enjoy locally-grown  apples and apple
products  direct from  the source, while walking
through  sloping  apple  orchards, picking fresh
apples, or munching on this  healthy fruit while
trekking.

The fact  that apple is a major import commodity
among  fruits  shows  the country  does not have
enough potential  to cater to  the local demand.
The country’s annual  production of apples stood
at 35,920 tonnes last fiscal, according to MoAD.
Apples are  cultivated in 48 districts, but five
districts   —  Jumla,  Humla,  Mugu,  Dolpa  and
Kalikot — contribute  41.2 percent  of the total
production."""
