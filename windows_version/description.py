about = """	        Welcome to Import and Export Prediction System


This  “Import and Export Prediction System”  is  prediction  system,  designed  to
predict and forecast  the  future import  and  export values of various agricultural
products of Nepal.  This  system evaluates  the  trend of import and export of top
listed  agricultural  products  on  basis  of  time  series  since  2009. The  data  for
predicted  products are  collected  from Export Import Data Bank, Undertaking of
Trade  and  Export Promotion  Center Nepal. This  System  is simple  prototype of
time series  trend  analysis  and  prediction,  proposed to visualize  the  trend and
predict  values of agricultural  goods coming  in  and  going  out, using the concept
of ARIMA model. Finally, to  per-evaluate  the  increase  in trade imbalance of the
products.

This is  proposed and designed for  the  partial fulfillment of  requirements for the
degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering. All  the  feedback and
comments are heartily welcomed. Necessary features will be enhanced in future."""

rice = """			---Import of Rice---              


Nearly 70  percent of Nepal's population  depends directly on agirculture, and the
sector contributes more  than a quater of the country's GDP-with rice making  up
21 percent of that. Till as late  as 1985, Nepal used to be a net exproter of rice &
during 1960s the country was exporting $45  million worth of rice  to India every
year. How the tables have  turned, in 2015 Nepal has to import 5,31,000 tons of
rice worth $210 million form India.

There are  many reason why Nepal’s production  of rice has  not kept up  with the
demand. The foremost, of course, is  that the country’s population has doubled in
the intervening  year. Agricultural land is  shrinking because  of urban  sprawl and
much of the farms are fallow because of outmigration. The educated youth do not
want to hold the land anymore, and look for salaried jobs in the cities or abroad."""



potato = """			---Import of Potato---              


Potato is considered as one of the fourth most important crops in  the world after
wheat, rice  and  maize. It  is one  of  the  important  cash  crops to  address food
insecurity  and  reduce  poverty  among  smallholder  farmers  in  the  developing
countries like Nepal. Its  cultivation  is  popular  among  farmers due  to  its wider
adaptability, high yield potential and high demand which contributes about 6.57 &
2.17 precent in AGDP and GDP, respectively. Potato is cultivated as a subsistence
crop which is the best potential for yield increment. 

Potatoes are used  as  subsidiary food  of vegetables in  Terai region, whereas as
staple food in Hill and Mountain regions. The demand of potato in the form of chips,
fries  and  mashed  potatoes  has  widened   its  scope  which  helps  to  uplift  the
economic condition of smallholder farmers. """


apple = """			---Import of Apple---              


Aside from seeing diverse landscape & abundant wildlife & learning about vibrant
local culture  &  traditions, there  is  another  reason  to  head  to the far-western 
Nepali  highlands. To  enjoy  locally-grown  apples  &  apple  products  direct from
the source, while walking through  sloping apple orchards, picking fresh apples, or
munching on this healthy fruit while trekking.

The fact that apple is a major import commodity among fruits shows the country
doesn't have enough potential to cater to the local demand. The country’s annual
production  of  apples  stood at 35,920  tonnes  in  last fiscal, according to  MoAD.
Apples are  cultivated in 48 districts,  but  five  districts  —  Jumla,  Humla,  Mugu,
Dolpa & Kalikot — contribute 41.2 percent of the total production."""
